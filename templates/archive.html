<h1>#Vanlife2016 The Adventure Begins</h1>
<h3>originally posted June 26, 2016</h3>
<br><br>
<p>Tove and I have often talked about downsizing and either roadtripping through Europe or building our own tiny house. After a few months dealing with an exceptionally irritating land-lord we decided to commit to a summer of van-dwelling. We packed up our furniture and things that we wanted to keep in a storage locker, redesigned the van and moved out of our apartment. Tove still had a few weeks of work before summer break so we found places to park by some of the forests and lakes near Bryne.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/van-bench.webp" alt="A bench (with storage), a sink, and a bed. What else do you need?">
<p>School is out and it is officially summer! The adventure can now start (even though we have already lived in the van around a month).  We climbed at my drytooling crag on Friday before heading to Bersagel for the weekend. The water jugs are full and batteries are charged and ready to go.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/van-parked-at-melsvatn.webp" alt="our van complete with solar panel. the world is our garden!">
<p>The plan forward is to drive down to Germany for the OutDoor Show in Friedrichshafen. According to the GPS we could be there in about a day. We have decided that we wanted to take our time getting there so we are going to be stopping along the way to hike and climb.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/reading-about-us-in-the-paper.webp" alt="Tove reading an article Stavanger Aftenbladet wrote about us">
<p>The first stop on our trip south is Nissedal in Telemark. Our sights are set on the ultra classic Via Lara before possibly trying something harder. Weather will most likely be the deciding factor for how long we stay before moving on.
    <br>
    Bohuslän and trad climbing along the Swedish coast are next on the list. I haven’t been to Bohuslän before but have heard a lot about the Mekka of Swedish trad climbing.
    <br>
    After Sweden we are planning to cruise through Denmark and make our way to Frankenjura, the birthplace of sport climbing. The middle of summer might not be the ideal time to climb in Frankenjura and it is more or less on the way.</p>
    <img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/gadi-at-bersagel.webp" alt="gadi is loving the adventure so far">
    <p>Before heading to Friedrichshafen and business at the OutDoor Show, we are going to stop by the little village of Habbach to visit our friends. Markus is a strong and experienced climber and he has offered to take some time off to climb with us and give us some tips for things to do in the Alps.
        <br>
        The OutDoor Show in Friedrichshafen July 13.-16. is the main event for our roadtrip and I hope to make some good contacts and arrangements at the meetings that I have scheduled.</p>
    <img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/drytooling-near-stavtjørn.webp" alt="climbing before we travel around to go climbing">
    <p>What we do after the Show is still pretty unclear. Talk of heading to Switzerland and Northern Italy has been prominent, but I suspect that we will figure it out along the way. The only thing certain is that we have to be back in Norway by the start of August.</p>

    <h1>Singing in the rain: climbing the hardest route up skeissfjell</h1>
    <h3>originally posted June 15, 2016</h3>
    <br><br>
    <p>Singing In the Rain E5 6b ~180m (a link-up of Noggin’ the Nog E5 6b ~160m and Recovery Nor 6 ~160m)
<br>
        11. June 2016 I was awoken at 5am by a cow that was licking my toes. I was parked in Ravndal 40min outside of Stavanger waiting to climb Skeisfjell. I had arrived the night before after dropping Tove off at Mekjarvik Quay, gone for a short walk with Gadi, ate a quick dinner and settled in for the night. The guys that I was going to climb with weren’t going to arrive for another few hours so I tried to get back to sleep with the van completely surrounded by cows.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/cows-near-ravndal.webp" alt="mmm(øø) let me lick those tasty toes!">
<p>When the others showed up we decided that we would split up in two teams: the Norwegians and the Foreigners. Torjus and Magnus wanted to climb Discovery (5+) so they headed up to the wall while Ludwik and I took a look at the guidebook. We finally decided that we wanted to try the hardest route up the wall Noggin’ the Nog E5 6b.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/torjus-on-discovery.webp" alt="torjus gives us a wave from discovery">
<p>Ludwik lead the first pitch up and through the first mini overhang to a belay at a decent ledge. I lead the next bit, combining the next two pitches ending with a belay on a blocky system of ledges at the base of the crux pitch. Ludwik was the first to try the E5 6b pitch but had to back off when he couldn’t find any good gear placements.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/ludwik-racks-up.webp" alt="ludwik racks up for the crux pitch">
<p>We swapped leads and I set off. I tried climbing farther to the left and managed to find a few moderate gear placements before moving out to the right. A few bouldery face moves on crimps,  slopes, and pinches lead me high above my last piece.  As I got to a flaring crack I placed two small stoppers and it began to rain.
<br>
    Looking up I saw that the next few moves were small crimps and slopers that lead to a poorly protected layback up two flaring grooves. The rain soaked the holds while I clung to the last positive holds.
    <br>
    We discussed our options and decided to bail and give it another shot the next day. We rapped back down and drank some coffee while we waited for the Norwegians to return. The sun crept back out and a slight breeze dried the stone as we watched the Norwegians top out.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/bailing-in-the-rain.webp" alt="bailing?! say it isnt so">
<p>12. June 2016 Ludwik had to drive some hitchhikers that had been staying with him to the airport so he didn’t show up until around 9am. We hiked back to the base of the cliff but decided to mix things up a bit by climbing a variation of another route up to the crux pitch from the day before. It was my turn to start things off today so I started up Recovery but soon went off route taking a more direct line through the I slabs. It may not have been as well protected as the normal line but the climbing was superb and I made my way safety to the belay in a small alcove behind a bush.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/ludwik-in-a-bush.webp" alt="ludwik finds his way into the belay cave">
<p>Recovery heads more or less straight up to the ridgeline from where we stood. We needed to get to the base of the crux pitch from Noggin’ the Nog so Ludwik made his way around the corner, traversing towards the left as he climbed up to the belay.
<br>
    It was technically my turn to lead but I had left some gear when bailing the day before and Ludwik wanted to try leading with the in-situ gear. He moved upwards and made it a good deal farther than the previous day. After a while though he had to return to the belay.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/ludwik-on-lead.webp" alt="ludwik finds a sneaky gear placement">
<p>We both wanted to climb the pitch so we went on back and forth until we finally made the next belay. Both of us were tired but pleased. Ludwik asked me to lead the last little stretch to the summit so once again I lead off from the belay.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/view-from-the-crux.webp" alt="the view from midway up the crux">
<p>When I had come 3-4 meters up it started to rain. This time a torrential downpour. A few frictiony holds were all that separated me from the top yet the rain made it impossible. I was forced to traverse out to easier climbing that lead to the top.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/wet-norwegian-weather.webp" alt="wet west-norwegian weather">
<p>When I at last gained the summit the clouds parted and the sun shined on Ludwik as he climbed to the top. Typical! In total we used 6 hours on the wall and we’re rained on 3 times (4 if you count the day before). We jokingly called our link-up Singing in the Rain.</p>

<h1>gloppedal climber's meet 2016</h1>
<h3>originally posted on June 7, 2016</h3>
<br><br>
<p>This past weekend, 3-5 June 2016, approximately 60 climbers from in and around Stavanger met up on the beach in Gloppedalsura for a weekend of swimming, grilling, bouldering, deep-water-soloing, and more. Everyone was gathered for the annual climbers meet held by Bratte Rogalands Venner.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/grilling-at-the-beach-in-gloppedalsura.webp" alt="grillong on the beach in gloppedalsura">
<p>Gloppedalsura is the largest talus field in Northern Europe. This may not seem that interesting until you get there and witness boulders the size of houses stacked up between two towering walls over 500m tall. All that plus an insanely beautiful sandy lakeside beach to hang out on.  A handful of bigwall routes have been put up throughout the years without making much of a dent. The main attraction for the weekend however was the bouldering.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/gloppedal-from-the-road.webp" alt="the beach as seen from the road">
<p>Most people who know me are well aware of the fact that I am terrible at bouldering and basically never do much if any of it outside of the gym. Still, Tove, Gadi and I set our sights on Gloppedalen for the weekend. We figured that we could hang out and be sociable and possibly do a bit of multi-pitch trad climbing in the neighboring valley if the weather was good.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/tove-and-gadi-by-the-gloppedal-sign.webp" alt="Tove and #GadiTheWonderDog ready for action">
<p>The event didn’t technically kick off until Saturday, but that didn’t stop around 24 of us from showing up at the beach Friday afternoon. We were staying in the van for the weekend so we just packed a bit of food and our little grill along with climbing shoes, chalk, and our camp chairs. The path down to the beach can be a bit tricky to find if you don’t know where it is,  but I have climbed on the southern wall of the valley so finding it was a breeze. With Gadi the Wonder-dog leading the way, we made our way down to the beach where we expected to meet Tai and some of the others who said that they would be there on Friday. To our surprise, the blue tent that we saw from the road wasn’t inhabited by climbers but rather a couple of drunk Russians and their cat! Luckily Pål was already there lounging on his crashpad, eying the Russians and their pirate flag, waiting for us to arrive. More people started to arrive and with them came more dogs (to Gadi’s excitement).</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/bouldering-in-gloppedalen.webp" alt="slapping slippery slopers in the sun">
<p>We hung out in the sun for a while before deciding that it was time to do a bit of climbing. There were a few boulders near the water that weren’t completely toasted by the sun so we decided to give them a try. We climbed right by the water’s edge on traversing problems above sand so soft you didn’t really need a crashpad. Most of the problems were in the 6a-6c range but felt slightly harder at times due to the glaring sun. Not exactly sending temperature. Still, boulders were topped out and fun was had by all. We grilled the kielbasa we had brought and enjoyed the sunset before making the trek back up to the van around 11:30.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/people- bouldering-in-gloppedalen.webp" alt="it is extremely crucial that you have at least one dog around when bouldering">
<p>The original plan was to wake up early the next morning and climb a 300m F5a+ about 15min away… you know what they say about best laid plans of mice (42?). We woke up a bit before 7, saw that the sun was shining in all its glory, baking the beach-dwellers.  Our van was still in the shade so we decided to do the lazy thing and sleep in a bit.  Two hours later we pulled ourselves out of bed, had a bite to eat, and brewed the weakest coffee this world has seen.  Any last delusions of climbing a wall in the sun all day were gone the way of the dodo.  We decided to cut our loses and make our way back down to the beach.  The forest behind the beach hides a few shorter cliffs just before the big walls that stretch into the cloudless sky.  I threw the rack and rope into my pack along with my chalk bucket for bouldering, holding on to the hope that temps in the forest would allow just a little bit of single-pitch trad. Once we hit the beach however, we knew the jig was up. The sun scorched cliffs weren’t going to be climbed today. We found a spot to sit and lounged in the sun. Eventually Tove pulled out the hammock and hung it up so that she and Gadi could sit in the relative coolness of the shade.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/tove-and-gadi-hanging-out-in-the-shade.webp" alt="a couple of shady characters">
<p>The temperature eventually subsided enough to try some more bouldering. I have never really understood the appeal of bouldering in comparison to climbing with a rope, but even I have to admit that there were a lot of highly enjoyable boulders.</p>
<img src="/static/posts/archived-blog/bouldering-is-hard.webp" alt="you know you are bouldering when you have done 10 moves before you get a meter off the ground">
<p>As you walked around the beach and made your way in and out of the forest you quickly realized just how many people showed up. There were hoards of climbers gathered together in groups all staring intently at huge rocks with smears of chalk all over. I can only imagine how it must have appeared for non-climbers. After a while the legions of half-naked dirt-covered rock-wranglers retreated out of the forest and congregated around the fire pit. The climbers from Bratte Rogalands Venner hung out as the sun set, discussing beta from boulders they had tried, route info for future reference, past climbs and conquests, along with plans for the next day. Some were staying on the beach while others were either heading back home or finding somewhere colder to climb. As for Tove and me, we ended up sleeping in before meeting a reporter from Stavanger Aftenbladet who want to write an article about us… but that is another story for another day.</p>
