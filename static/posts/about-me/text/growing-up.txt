Growing up in the Wasatch Range of Utah provided an early connection to the mountains.  Park City is a major hub for winter sports and introduced me early on to athletic competition in the form of Nordic Ski Jumping.  I traveled throughout North America, Europe, and even Asia for training and competitions.  In January 2007 in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, I had a bad fall that resulted in a crushed clavicle, broken ribs, and a broken femur.  Not only did the crash end my career, but the injuries required multiple surgeries and months of rehabilitation and training.  The femur fracture didn't heal properly and I was forced to have a total hip replacement in 2010. Luckily, I heal quickly and am extremely stubborn when it comes to admitting defeat.
