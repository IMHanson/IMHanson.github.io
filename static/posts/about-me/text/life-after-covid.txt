Covid hit and we had to go into lock-down. This was the longest I had spent without traveling for as long as I can remember. On the bright side, this meant that I got to spend more time with my wife and our two young daughters. The girls were too young to really unstand what was going on, and were happy to just play games, and watch movies all day.  I used this time to get back into music, and started to teach myself about electronics, and built a few guitar pedals before building a modular synthesizer. After lockdown, I continued learning about electronics, and started experimenting with recreating songs that I like. Since then I have built a guitar tube amplifier, tube-driven spring reverb unit, two guitars, wound my own pickups, and started repairing guitars for the local music school. I also purchased an electric Rhodes Suitecase Piano which I have been restoring. I started to teach myself how to code so that I could make even more exciting projects.  I don't really know what is to come, but I am excited to find out!
