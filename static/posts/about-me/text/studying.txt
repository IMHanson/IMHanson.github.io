Back in Utah, had my hip replacement and attended the University of Utah. I filled up my schedule with Parks, Recreation and Tourism: Adventure and Outdoor Programs, Ice-Climbing, Canyoneering, Ski-Mountaineering, Back-Country Ski Guiding, Digital Photography, and Emergency Medicine. The whole time my mind was focused on returning to Norway. I applied for a school in Telemark, but didnt't get in since I didn't have papers showing that I knew Norwegian. The tests required to prove that I knew the language were only held a few times a year in Norway. I immediatly registered for them and flew to Norway to stay with my then-girlfriend(now wife) while I waited to take the tests. Now that I had the proof that I needed, I reapplied to the school in Telemark and got accepted.  The problem now was that it was December and my 90-day visa was about to expire. Knowing that I would be starting school the coming fall, I went back to Utah and got a job as a liftie at Alta Ski Resort. I spent most of my time skiing, climbing, playing music, and counting down the days until I was back in Norway. Luckily, I only had to wait a few months.  I spent the next couple of years in Telemark studying Mountaineering, Glacier Travel, Climbing, and Sailing. My wife and I got married in 2014.
