After our time in Telemark we moved to my wife's hometown of Stavanger, where she got a job as an art teacher, and I found work climbing/coaching. I found my passion for ice and mixed climbing while living in Lofoten, and begain competing in the UIAA Ice Climbing World Cup in 2015. Climbing took me to incredible places all around the world, and introduced me to some wonderful people. I took the UIAA International Routesetter course which only got me even more involved with the sport. I worked as an aspirant routesetter for the Junior World Championships in Champagney, France, Malbun, Liechtenstein, along with the European Cup finals in Oulu, Finland, and the Russian Championships in Tomsk, Russia. I was chief routesetter at the European Cup competition in Utrecht, Netherlands.
