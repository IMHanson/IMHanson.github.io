I moved to Lillehammer, Norway in 2008 as an exchange student through AFS. My host parents were both art teachers. I formed a very tight bond with my host father, we would often go on long hikes/ski trips without any particular goal in mind. Other times we would sit by the fireplace, sipping tea and discussing life, history, art, music, language, and anything else that might cross our minds. Norway felt like home and I knew that I wanted to stay, so I applied and got accecpted to a folk high school in Northern Norway. During my time in Lillehammer I started having severe hip pain, and started to worry that something might be wrong. I went to see my doctor when I got back to Utah and was told that the femur fracture hadn't healed properly and I developed osteonecrosis, commonly known as avascular necrosis.  Apparently, the injured area never regained proper blood circulation resulting in death of the bone tissue. My hip had completely worn through the cartilage, and parts of the hip socket. The actual head of the femur was ground down and partially collapsed. I needed a total hip replace. Obviously, I was devastated, but after talked with the doctor I decided to put off the surgery. He said that I technically couldn't make things worse since everything needed to be replaced anyway, only that I would probably be in severe pain until I got it fixed. So the following year I moved to Kabelvåg, a small village located in the Lofoten archipelago above the Arctic Circle.  While there I studyed mountaineering, and ice climbed for the first time. More importantly, that is where I met my wife, who was studying photography at the same school. Unfortunately, the program only lasted a year and I knew that I had to go back to Utah for my hip replacement, but I knew that I wanted to go back to Norway.
